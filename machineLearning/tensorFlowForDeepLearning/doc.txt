TensorFlow for Deep Learning

Chapter 2. Introduction to TensorFlow Primitives
    0. introduction
	a. tensorflow is built on tensorial mathematics
	b. tensorflow code describes computations in a computational graph
    1. Scalars, Vectors, and Matrices
	a. a rank-0 tensor is a scalar:
		0. a single constant value.
		1. a scalar is drawn from a real number (+ or - decimal numbers).
		2. real numbers will be denoted R.
	b. a rank-1 tensor is a vector, or list of real numbers
		0. a vector is a column or a row
		1. a vector has a shape of (n, 1) or (1, n).
		2. examples of vectors might be:
		    a. a superheros strength, speed, and power (space R3).
		    b. a molecules subfragments in terms of binary vectors.
	c. a rank-2 tensor is a matrix
		0. matrices are like columns and rows, of shape (n, n).
		1. traditionally, matrices are used to transform vectors.
		2.  a function f is called linear if f(x + y) = f(x) + f(y) and f(cx) = cf(x) where c is a scalar. 
	d. a rank-3 tensor is like a prism, or layers of isomorphic matrices
		0. a rank-3 tensor has 3 required indices, or shape (n, n, n). 
    2. Basic Computations in Tensorflow
	a. Initializing Constant Tensors
		0. tensor objects
		    a. a = tf.zeros(2) returns a ref to a (2,), 0-valued scalar.
		    b. a.eval() will return the actual numpy.ndarray object.
		    c. tf.zeros(2,3) returns a ref for a ((2,3)) tensor.
