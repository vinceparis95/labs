Chapter 4. Machine Learning for Molecules
    0. introduction
	a. The dream of molecular machine learning is molecule design.
	b. We need to be able to transform molecules into vectors.
 	c. Vectors of numbers can be passed to mL algorithms.
	d. converting molecules into vectors is called molecular featurization.
	e. different ways of featurizing molecules include:
		0. chemical descriptors;
		1. 2D graph representations;
		2. 3D electrostatic grid representations;
		3. orbital basis function representations;  
    1. What is a Molecule?
	a. A molecule, or "m", is a group of atoms
	b. the atoms are joined by physical forces.
	c. atoms are connected by *chemical bonds*.
	d. chemical bonds hold atoms together and restrict their interplay.
	e. m's are the smallest unit of chem compound which parcipate in chem reactions.
	f. molecules can be a few or so so many atoms.
	g. We use mass spectroscopy to "see" molecules:
		0. hose down a sample with electrons;
		1. molecule shatters into *ionized* fragments;
		2. The fragments are propelled by electric field;
		3. The propulsion separates them by their mass to charge ratio;
		4. We detect the charged fragments, which is called the spectrum; 
	h. molecules are *quantum*:
		0. Atoms in molecules are in rapid motion relative to each other;
		1. The chemical bonds stretch back and forth, oscillating;
		2. The atoms often break off from or join with molecules;
		3. The atoms and bonds are fuzzy and exhibit quantum effects;
		4. quantum effects include superposition, and entanglement.
    2. What are Molecular bonds?
	a. Bonds are the glue of shared electrons that hold the atoms together.
	b. Covelant bonds are cool:
		0. Covalant bonds involve sharing electrons between 2 atoms.
		1. Covalent bonds are the strongest type of chemical bond.
		2. A molecule itself is a set of atoms joined by covalant bonds.
