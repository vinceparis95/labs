Quantum Computing: A Gentle Introduction

Chapter 3: Multi Qubit Systems
    0. introduction
	a. State space of quantum systems grows exponentially with each particle.
	b. We can't describe states of individual qubits, when they're entangled.  
    1. Quantum State Spaces
	a. Vector spaces for possible states of classical systems are 2n.
	b. Vector spaces for possible states of quantum systems are 2^n.
	c. Direct sums of vector systems play a huge role.
!	    1. The direct sum, V#W of 2 vector spaces V and W is just combination.
		a. A#B for A = {|a1,a2|} and B = {|b1,b2|} is {|a1,a2,b1,b2|}
		b. Every element |x} e V#W can be written as x = |v}#|w}. 
	d. Tensor Products play a big time role too.
	    1. If tp = V##W with bases A = {|a1},|a2}} and B = {|b1,b2|}:	
		a. tp = nm dimensional vector with e's of the form |ai}##|b1}
!		b.
