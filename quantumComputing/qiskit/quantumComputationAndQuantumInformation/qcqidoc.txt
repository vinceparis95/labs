2.Introduction to quantum mechanics
2.2 Posulated of quantum mechanics
    0. introduction
	a. Quantum mechanics is a mathematical framework. 
    2.2.1 State Space
	a. Associated to any isolated physical system is a complex vector space.
	b. Inner product of this state space, or Hilbert, is the state space. 
	c. The system is completely described by its state space. 
	d. the simplex quantum system is a qubit, (has a 2D state space)
	e. If 0 and 1 form an orthonormal basis, then:
	    1. then a state vector in that space can be |v} = a|0}+b|b}.
    2.2.2 Evolution
	a. The evolution of a closed quantum system is decribed by a unitary transformation.
	b. The state |v} of the system at time t1 is related to |v'} at time t2.
	c. The states are related by unitary op U which depends on t1 and t2.
	d. |v'} = U |v}
